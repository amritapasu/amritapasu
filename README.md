## Hi, I'm Amrita Pasupathy. 
Computer Science undergrad at Caltech 
Class of '27

I'm interested in Software Development and Machine Learning. This past summer, I did research at Caltech with Professor Domniki Asimaki on using the Ensamble Kalman Method, a derivative-free optimization, to develop GMM-consistent velocity profiles for site-response analyses.
